---------------
1.   Code for Section 3 (Species Embeddings)

 All the code to generate species embeddings, using 
phylogeny_embeddings/EmbeddingsTestBed.ipynb from github

Run all the cells that have the following comment on top
### FOR WRITEUP:  INITIAL PROCESSING

run
### FOR WRITEUP:  INITIAL PROCESSING #1

throught
### FOR WRITEUP:  INITIAL PROCESSING #21

note, some cells do not appear in order


---------------
2. Code for Section 4 (Sequence to Embedding Model)

modify the code as necessary if paths/names have changed
Also, assumes the relevant cells from (### FOR WRITEUP:  INITIAL PROCESSING...) have been run

2.1
All the cells that process data for the network, and then evaluate the results are in 
phylogeny_embeddings/EmbeddingsTestBed.ipynb from github
